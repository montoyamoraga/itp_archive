# Assignment: Reading response to excerpts from "Empty Space" by Peter Brook

Even though someone walking over a stage could be considered as theatre, this is not what is meant by it. Theatre also isn't about the box office, foyer, tip-up seats, scene changes and intervals.

According to the author, the word theatre has four different meanings:

* Deadly Theatre
* Holy Theatre
* Rough Theatre
* Immediate Theatre

They can coexist right next to each other, be separated miles apart, and even get mixed together in the same act of the same play, even in one fleeting moment.

## The Deadly Theatre

This theatre means bad theatre. This is the one we most often see and is closely linked to commercial theatre, even though its deadliness can appear anywhere.

The Deadly Theatre is most prominent in Shakespeare plays. Even though the actors, characters, costumes, music and scenery are great, we find it boring.

The difference between life and dead in humans is crystal clear, but not so in theatre. When plays from the past are executed, they can try to be faithful to the text, but the text is just a vehicle of the meaning, which gets lost, and thus it becomes Deadly Theatre. Also, the imitation of manners is just a manner, which is hard to find relatable.

Words and text are an end-product of artistic impulses of expression. They are not set in stone and merely approaching them as utterances with a certain style by mouths of actors is losing the point and being Deadly.

In a living theatre, every rehearsal and showcase consists of putting yesterday's discoveries to test, because each day the play escapes from us. From the day the play is set, it starts to die. Theatre is a self-destructive art.

Music and drama are treated in opera as one, but esentially they are not. Music is the most abstract expression, its sounds made by instruments that hardly ever change. Personalities of instrumentalists are not relevant, music and its vehicle are separate entities. This is why music is free of the need to be revised. Drama is the opposite, you can't separate the message from the flesh and bones that delivers it. This is why grand opera is the Deadly Theatre ad nauseam.

There is a great contradiction in the relationship between audience and theatre. Without an audience, there would be no theatre, so they are responsible of it, but at the same time, it's hard to educate them about their responsibility. Audiences can make and break theatre.

Another aspect of the Deadliness of theatre is the timing and budget constraints. Actors tend to stop getting educated in order to allocate more time to plays and career goals, so their acting tend to stay fixed, and thus, Deadly.

The author claims that is the critics the most dangerous and Deadly aspect of theatre, even though without them theatre would be prey of greater dangers. It is not also essential for the critic to be Deadly, but it turns out like that as a result of repeating all over again the same job under not stimulating conditions and not exercising its vital role of poking and analyzing theatre in a dialogue with it.

A further comparison is drawn between theatre and music. In music, the level is high, with countless of professional and amateur musicians capable of executing very complex and demanding pieces. On the other hand, in theatre, because of its multidisciplinary approach and immediacy, it's very hard to achieve competence, so bad and Deadly theatre is all over the place and critics are exposed to it, thus making it harder for them not to grumble.

Critics are both callers for competence and pathmakers. The critic should have a vision of what theatre in his/her community should be. The more a critic becomes an insider, the better.

Also writers can be Deadly, being uninspired and not pushing the boundaries of stereotypes and not giving social commentary.

The director doesn't have to let the speak play, rather to conjure up its sound, it has to be an active agent in the revival of the play out of just plain text.

## The Immediate Theatre

Even as the world becomes more globalized and interconnected, theatre remains limited in scope, for example, in terms of cast and relationships between characters.

Also, unlike most people that could perfectly live without theatre, theatre can't live without the real world, since it is a reflection of it.

The difference between a movie and theatre, is that the movie achieves intimacy and realness by projecting images from the past, meanwhile theatre is all about the present moment, the Immediate.

Theater is a place where the design of the set is key, but that doesn't mean it is fixed or complete. Good staging design begs for being flexible and in constant dialogue with the play during the rehearsals, in order to be at service of the play and not imposing limitations to it. The design of the set is always in motion.

Talent is not static, it changes according to the context for the actors, so casting is a difficult enterprise and should be flexible.

Rehearsals are a process. The art of the director is to grasp the fleeting moments that arise. The director's ideas must be in constant evolution and subject to the rehearsal's stimuli. Theatre is a medium which evolves as it responds.

A director then is totally responsible for the process which he/she is part of, by means of attacking, yielding and provoking until everything begins to flow.

Spontaneity often has unreal aspects. When in horror, an actor would tend to open the mouth and scream, which is a clich√© and might be just trained conduct instead of a real response, which is natural, since it is acting, not reality.

Improvisation tries to steer away from Deadly theatre, by making it more Immediate. The hardest task for an author is to be both sincere yet detached. This is especially hard, since unlike any other arts which provide a natural way of detaching the self from the piece, while acting the performer is fully immersed in the moment even physically and is hard this way to learn from own experience.

Theatre, unlike any other arts, is unpermanent. It needs of repetition, representation and assistance to come alive. Theatre is alive while on motion.
