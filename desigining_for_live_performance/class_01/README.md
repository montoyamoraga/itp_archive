## the art of the possible credo, by [kennet koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Koch)

vanishing is impossible

lasting is impossible

being in two places at once is impossible

speaking the entire truth is impossible

instantly knowing spanish is impossible

living in the midst of ten thousand panes of glass is impossible

being simultaneously masked and unmasked is impossible

except in art

art is the art of the possible


## goals of this course

* create conceptually strong designs
* create emotionally compelling choices
* collaborate with performers and members of the creative team
* let designs respond to performers, sounds, and 3d space
* make designs reliable and scalable

## interactivity

when an agent listens, processes what it receives and responds.

though responses come from a set of coded instructions, responses can vary greatly depending upon what is received.

## performance

"performances mark identities, bend time, reshape and adorn the body, and tell stories. performances - of art, rituals, or ordinary life - are 'restored behaviors', 'twice-behaved behaviors', performed actions that people train for and rehearse." - [richard schechner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schechner)

## 8 kinds of performance

1. in everyday life - cooking, socializing, "just living"
* in the arts
* in sports and other popular entertainments
* in business
* in technology
* in sex
* in ritual - sacred and secular
* in play

## performing onstage

"when an actor is completely absorbed by some profoundly moving objective so that he throws his whole being passionately into its execution, he reaches a state we call inspiration." - [konstantin stanislavski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Stanislavski)

## crafting your concept

## mary overlie's 6 viewpoints

* space: the ability to perceive physical relationship.
* story: the ability to perceive and collect information over a period of time and make conclusions.
* time: the ability to perceive duration and systems designed to regulate duration.
* emotion: the ability to perceive states of feeling and to be put into states of feeling.
* movement: the ability to identify through memory kinetic states.
* shape: the ability to respond to form.

### the viewpoints of time

* tempo: the rate of speed at which a movement occurs; how fast or slow something happens onstage.
* duration: how long a movement of sequence of movement continues.
* kinesthetic response: a spontaneous reaction to motion which occurs outside you.
* repetition: the repeating of something onstage. repetition includes internal repetition and external repetition.

### viewpoints of space

* shape: the contour or outline the body (or bodies) make in space. all shape can be broken down into either lines, curves or a combination of lines and curves. in addition, shape can either be stationary or moving in space.
* gesture: a movement involving a part or parts of the body; gesture is shape with a beginning, middle, and end. gesture is broken down into behavioral gestures and expressive gestures
* architecture: the physical environment in which you are working and how awareness of it affects movement
