# Assignment: Reading response to "EF's visit to a small planet: Some questions to ask a play" by Elinor Fuchs.

In the text, Fuchs proposes that "the study of art shows us how to live".
This phrase stands out for me because of open-ended invitation to do art, to study it, to get better at this thing called life. I have experienced catharsis with poems and theatre and learned how to live better, and it rings a bell with my favorite author, Manuel Scorza, a Latin American writer who states that he uses art in order to achieve social justice by reporting crimes and offenses, that were never punished by the law. This would be a corollary of Fuch's.

Another aspect that was very revealing for me was when she claims that "in the world of the play there are no accidents." Not even chance is random and unexpected on a play. Everything in a play is of significance, so it is our task as audience to ask questions, instead of make judgments.

The approach to seeing the play as "another world passing before you in time and space" echoes to me the definition of music and sound art, which would be an acoustic waveform world passing before you both in time and space, dynamically changing amplitudes, by means of amplification and resonance. Also, just as in music and sound art the sheet music or the annotations are just a tiny fraction of the actual performance, in theater also language is just one part of the world. Also the language habits set a different tone and mood according to the different vehicles of language expression, such as dialogues, monologues, silences, in both prose and verse.

Similar considerations apply for time in the theatre and in sound. Without time flowing there would be no perception of sound at all, and the same happens with theater, where the play has a timeline, a rhythm and a tempo.

Just as the world we inhabit, the play's world possesses sociopolitical aspects. This world can be about individuals, leaders, groups. The characters can engage in fights, discussions and different ways of interaction and administration of power. This power can be articulated and exerted in different ways and to different agents.

Interactivity is present in the theatre, not just in the most explicit way of breaking the fourth wall or asking for the audience's collaboration, but in the emotional demands that theatre asks you for and what changes you experience in yourself during the play. the play is the agent that triggers an answer on you, which can be both pro and contra the play's original intention.

In order to understand characters, we must understand the complex patterns that they inhabit and interact with. This pattern is indeed a characteristic of the play's world, but it must be flexible enough to also admit events that don't fit. There exist several different elements that constitute a world, and their type can be visual, aural, temporal, tonal or figural. Every character trait is a reflection of the conditions of the world it inhabits.
