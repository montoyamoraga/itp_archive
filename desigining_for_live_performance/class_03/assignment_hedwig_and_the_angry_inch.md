## Fuch's questions for **Hedwig And The Angry Inch**

### The world of the play

This play is set on a stage where there is a band, The Angry Inch, and the main performer Hedwig and her husband, Yitzhak.

Through a door we can hear and see another venue in the same city, New York, where a concert by artist Tommy Gnosis is being held.

This play's timespan is the actual clock duration of it, but in it there is a lot of flashbacks to Hedwig's past, that she tells about.

The atmosphere of the play is tense, with Hedwig being very angry and jealous at Tommy's success and hurt because of his indifference. Also, he is both in pain and in a defiant attiude as he tells the story of her life.

This play is heavy on dialogue (and music), and most of the lines are delivered while sung.

### The social world of the play

This is a world where drag queens and various forms of sexual identities are accepted. It is also a post Cold War world, where the major political issues have fallen apart and now people can concentrate on being themselves.

This world revolves around Hedwig, with all of the other characters having a direct relationship to her, by being former or current lovers or players of her band.

### What changes?

During this play, Hedwig goes from being super menacing and imposing, to break down and fall apart and then finally being calm and serene about his present.

Also, his marriage to Yitzhak goes from being manipulative and based on his giving up of his drag performances, to Hedwig accepting it and even encouraging it, gaining in trust after Yitzhak becomes aware of all of Hedwig's life story.

Something stable is Hedwig's constant defining of herself based on her current romantic situation. Most of her happiness and pain and important life decisions are based on her love story.

My first impression was that Hedwig was trying to appear braver and more confident that she actual was, but after going through her history of failures and painful situations, I changed my mind and admired her ability to overcome difficulties.

This play also achieved to portray the vulnerability of Hedwig, who is willing to give up and transform her whole life and identity in the search of love, even after she fails multiple times.

This play echoes a lot of rock and glam icons, both in the portrayal of sexual minorities, the aesthetics and the music being played, very characteristic of the late seventies and early eighties, by the likes of David Bowie and Lou Reed.

Its arc is based on Greek tragedies, where the main character overcomes a series of difficulties and after a climax achieves the serenity to accept her own fate.

### The character fits the pattern

The play is set up in a falling apart world, based on the remains of another play, and this fits the emotional decay and struggle of Hedwig.
