## dns

dns stands for domain name

you can search the host of any web address with the command *host* on the terminal.

you can do for example *host itp.nyu.edu*

## https

https stands for http with security. the connections to and from the client (browser) and the server (our node server) is going to be encrypted.

google chrome made the decision that you can't access certain aspects of the browser without using https.

## itp.io

itp bought the domain itp.io and shawn controls it.
now i can log in through *ssh root@my_nyu_id.itp.io* and my same password as before.
