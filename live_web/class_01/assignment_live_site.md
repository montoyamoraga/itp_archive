# assignment: live site

i found this compilation on the internet:
[https://www.thrillist.com/tech/nation/weird-and-hilarious-webcams-around-the-world-bizarre-things-on-the-internet](https://www.thrillist.com/tech/nation/weird-and-hilarious-webcams-around-the-world-bizarre-things-on-the-internet)

i liked these sites:

* [watching grass grow](http://www.watching-grass-grow.com/): it's a live feed of a yard where grass grows, it includes also an archive of special occasions and the mouse has interactivity, with a very glitchy mower that follows it.

*[bubble cam] (http://andieandmike.org/bubblecam/index.php): you can trigger bubbles from a bubble machine during daylight.

[drive me insane]
(http://www.drivemeinsane.com/): you can control lights on a room and there is a live chat.
