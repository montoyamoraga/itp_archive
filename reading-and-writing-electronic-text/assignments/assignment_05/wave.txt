[Verse 1]
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away

[Hook]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
A wave
Wave

[Verse 2]
I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Ni√±o
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

[Hook]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
A wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
A wave
