[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 1]
When you're on a holiday
You can’t find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

[Sub-Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 2]
When you're on a golden sea
You don’t need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Outro]
Hip hip
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip, hip hip)
No no (Hip hip)
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip)
No no (Hip hip)
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

[Spoken Word: Mykel Allen & Karl Koch]
Hey, what’s up?
Not much
Did you hear about the party?

Um, I think I’m gonna go but, um, my friends don’t really wanna go. Could I get a ride?

[Verse 2]
Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-Bye
Who I
I think
I sink
And I die

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Outro]
I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor, I've come undone



Ya se que voy a llorar
Que me voy a quejar
Que me voy a reir
Se que en la oscuridad
No se puede ver nada si tu no estas aqui
Duro dos segundos el atardecer
Me quemo por dentro
El alma y el cuerpo
La sangre esta hirviendo
Me quemo por dentro
El alma y el cuerpo
Me quemo por dentro
Y yo...no puede estar mas asi
Y yo...no puedo estar mas asi ahhh
Sin alma en el cuerpo
Me quemo por dentro
Me quemo por dentro
Sin alma en el cuerpo
Me quemo por dentro
Me quemo por dentro
Ya se que no vendra
Nadie te va a enseñar
Lo que es estar asi
Que en esta soledad
Enfrenta la verdad
Es casi como huir
Duro dos segundos el atardecer
Me quemo por dentro
El alma y el cuerpo
La sangre esta hirviendo
Me quemo por dentro
El alma y el cuerpo



[Verse 1]
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away

[Hook]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
A wave
Wave

[Verse 2]
I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Niño
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

[Hook]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
A wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
A wave
