[Verse 1]
I'm me
Me be
Goddamn

I can
Sing and
Hear me
Know me

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

[Spoken Word: Mykel Allen & Karl Koch]
Hey, what’s up?
Not much
Did you hear about the party?
Yeah
Um, I think I’m gonna go but, um, my friends don’t really wanna go. Could I get a ride?

[Verse 2]
Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-Bye
Who I
I think
I sink
And I die

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

[Outro]
I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor, I've come undone
