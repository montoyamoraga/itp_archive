It's like I never had to see it in your eyes or feel it
I could tell when you smile
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much, I could tell
When you smile
All of the subatomic pieces come together and
Unfold themselves in a second
Every single molecule is right, when
All of the subatomic pieces come together and unfold
Themselves in a second
