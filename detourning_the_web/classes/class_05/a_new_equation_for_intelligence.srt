1
00:00:00,899 --> 00:00:04,566
Intelligence -- what is it?

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,857
If we take a look back at the history

3
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:09,481
of how intelligence has been viewed,

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:13,099
one seminal example has been

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,576
Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that

6
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:19,687
"the question of whether a machine can think

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,997
is about as interesting

8
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,968
as the question of whether a submarine

9
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,758
can swim."

10
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:29,602
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,

11
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:31,656
intended it as a criticism

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,656
of the early pioneers of computer science,

13
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,403
like Alan Turing.

14
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,902
However, if you take a look back

15
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:40,867
and think about what have been

16
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,863
the most empowering innovations

17
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:44,742
that enabled us to build

18
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,976
artificial machines that swim

19
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,549
and artificial machines that [fly],

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,096
you find that it was only through understanding

21
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,704
the underlying physical mechanisms

22
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:58,483
of swimming and flight

23
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:01,655
that we were able to build these machines.

24
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,911
And so, several years ago,

25
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:07,160
I undertook a program to try to understand

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,794
the fundamental physical mechanisms

27
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,562
underlying intelligence.

28
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,422
Let's take a step back.

29
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,571
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.

30
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,425
Pretend that you're an alien race

31
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,466
that doesn't know anything about Earth biology

32
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,582
or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,

33
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:28,774
but you have amazing telescopes

34
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:31,136
and you're able to watch the Earth,

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,468
and you have amazingly long lives,

36
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,967
so you're able to watch the Earth

37
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,409
over millions, even billions of years.

38
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,424
And you observe a really strange effect.

39
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:45,736
You observe that, over the course of the millennia,

40
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:50,021
Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids

41
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:52,108
up until a point,

42
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,639
and that at some point,

43
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:57,831
corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,

44
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,547
asteroids that are on

45
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,478
a collision course with the Earth

46
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,453
that otherwise would have collided

47
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,868
mysteriously get deflected

48
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,940
or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,023
Now of course, as earthlings,

50
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,567
we know the reason would be

51
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,323
that we're trying to save ourselves.

52
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:17,403
We're trying to prevent an impact.

53
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,114
But if you're an alien race

54
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,260
who doesn't know any of this,

55
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,774
doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,

56
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,502
you'd be forced to put together

57
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:27,420
a physical theory that explains how,

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,958
up until a certain point in time,

59
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:34,407
asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet

60
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:37,638
mysteriously stop doing that.

61
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:41,842
And so I claim that this is the same question

62
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:45,840
as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,722
So in this program that I
undertook several years ago,

64
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:52,487
I looked at a variety of different threads

65
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:55,649
across science, across a variety of disciplines,

66
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,541
that were pointing, I think,

67
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,089
towards a single, underlying mechanism

68
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,670
for intelligence.

69
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,216
In cosmology, for example,

70
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,963
there have been a variety of
different threads of evidence

71
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:10,370
that our universe appears to be finely tuned

72
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,523
for the development of intelligence,

73
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:14,912
and, in particular, for the development

74
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:16,798
of universal states

75
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,896
that maximize the diversity of possible futures.

76
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,240
In game play, for example, in Go --

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,265
everyone remembers in 1997

78
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:30,216
when IBM's Deep Blue beat 
Garry Kasparov at chess --

79
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:31,739
fewer people are aware

80
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,757
that in the past 10 years or so,

81
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:34,955
the game of Go,

82
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,911
arguably a much more challenging game

83
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,336
because it has a much higher branching factor,

84
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,038
has also started to succumb

85
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,903
to computer game players

86
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,476
for the same reason:

87
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:47,276
the best techniques right now
for computers playing Go

88
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,972
are techniques that try to maximize future options

89
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,986
during game play.

90
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,567
Finally, in robotic motion planning,

91
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,749
there have been a variety of recent techniques

92
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,651
that have tried to take advantage

93
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,797
of abilities of robots to maximize

94
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:05,303
future freedom of action

95
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:08,400
in order to accomplish complex tasks.

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,755
And so, taking all of these different threads

97
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,377
and putting them together,

98
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,017
I asked, starting several years ago,

99
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,867
is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence

100
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:19,540
that we can factor out

101
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,314
of all of these different threads?

102
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:25,907
Is there a single equation for intelligence?

103
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,278
And the answer, I believe, is yes.
["F = T ∇ Sτ"]

104
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,191
What you're seeing is probably

105
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:34,485
the closest equivalent to an E = mc²

106
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:37,315
for intelligence that I've seen.

107
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,017
So what you're seeing here

108
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,686
is a statement of correspondence

109
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:46,121
that intelligence is a force, F,

110
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:50,771
that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.

111
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,146
It acts to maximize future freedom of action,

112
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,774
or keep options open,

113
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:56,999
with some strength T,

114
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:01,776
with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,

115
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,326
up to some future time horizon, tau.

116
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:07,535
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.

117
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,590
Intelligence tries to maximize
future freedom of action

118
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,263
and keep options open.

119
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,696
And so, given this one equation,

120
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:18,228
it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?

121
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:19,579
How predictive is it?

122
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,714
Does it predict human-level intelligence?

123
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,532
Does it predict artificial intelligence?

124
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,574
So I'm going to show you now a video

125
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:29,994
that will, I think, demonstrate

126
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,282
some of the amazing applications

127
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,601
of just this single equation.

128
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,580
(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology

129
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,627
has suggested that universes that produce

130
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:42,108
more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes

131
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,586
should tend to have more favorable conditions

132
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,602
for the existence of intelligent
beings such as ourselves.

133
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:50,176
But what if that tentative cosmological connection

134
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:52,019
between entropy and intelligence

135
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,790
hints at a deeper relationship?

136
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,354
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate

137
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,198
with the production of long-term entropy,

138
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,516
but actually emerges directly from it?

139
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,922
To find out, we developed a software engine

140
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,425
called Entropica, designed to maximize

141
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,193
the production of long-term entropy

142
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,769
of any system that it finds itself in.

143
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,924
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass

144
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:15,380
multiple animal intelligence
tests, play human games,

145
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,526
and even earn money trading stocks,

146
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,637
all without being instructed to do so.

147
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,155
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.

148
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,360
Just like a human standing
upright without falling over,

149
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,590
here we see Entropica

150
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,475
automatically balancing a pole using a cart.

151
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,487
This behavior is remarkable in part

152
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,818
because we never gave Entropica a goal.

153
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:36,975
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.

154
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:39,107
This balancing ability will have appliactions

155
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,504
for humanoid robotics

156
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:43,019
and human assistive technologies.

157
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,020
Just as some animals can use objects

158
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,462
in their environments as tools

159
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,449
to reach into narrow spaces,

160
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,331
here we see that Entropica,

161
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,169
again on its own initiative,

162
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,079
was able to move a large
disk representing an animal

163
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,424
around so as to cause a small disk,

164
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,195
representing a tool, to reach into a confined space

165
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,732
holding a third disk

166
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,704
and release the third disk
from its initially fixed position.

167
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,893
This tool use ability will have applications

168
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,252
for smart manufacturing and agriculture.

169
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,196
In addition, just as some other animals

170
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,892
are able to cooperate by pulling
opposite ends of a rope

171
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,945
at the same time to release food,

172
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,240
here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,228
a model version of that task.

174
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,750
This cooperative ability has interesting implications

175
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,185
for economic planning and a variety of other fields.

176
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,256
Entropica is broadly applicable

177
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,199
to a variety of domains.

178
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,641
For example, here we see it successfully

179
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:35,200
playing a game of pong against itself,

180
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,543
illustrating its potential for gaming.

181
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:39,462
Here we see Entropica orchestrating

182
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,301
new connections on a social network

183
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:44,061
where friends are constantly falling out of touch

184
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,917
and successfully keeping
the network well connected.

185
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,215
This same network orchestration ability

186
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,543
also has applications in health care,

187
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,775
energy, and intelligence.

188
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,860
Here we see Entropica directing the paths

189
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,346
of a fleet of ships,

190
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,521
successfully discovering and
utilizing the Panama Canal

191
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,979
to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic

192
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,508
to the Pacific.

193
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,235
By the same token, Entropica

194
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,855
is broadly applicable to problems

195
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:14,157
in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.

196
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:16,203
Finally, here we see Entropica

197
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:18,926
spontaneously discovering and executing

198
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,993
a buy-low, sell-high strategy

199
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,171
on a simulated range traded stock,

200
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,502
successfully growing assets under management

201
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:26,926
exponentially.

202
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:28,234
This risk management ability

203
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,721
will have broad applications in finance

204
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:34,049
and insurance.

205
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,140
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen

206
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,532
is that a variety of signature human intelligent

207
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,289
cognitive behaviors

208
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,120
such as tool use and walking upright

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,149
and social cooperation

210
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,121
all follow from a single equation,

211
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,053
which drives a system

212
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:55,964
to maximize its future freedom of action.

213
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:58,971
Now, there's a profound irony here.

214
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,995
Going back to the beginning

215
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:04,268
of the usage of the term robot,

216
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,171
the play "RUR,"

217
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,406
there was always a concept

218
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:12,632
that if we developed machine intelligence,

219
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:15,659
there would be a cybernetic revolt.

220
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,210
The machines would rise up against us.

221
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,529
One major consequence of this work

222
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,298
is that maybe all of these decades,

223
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,274
we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt

224
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,285
in reverse.

225
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:32,564
It's not that machines first become intelligent

226
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,579
and then megalomaniacal

227
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,803
and try to take over the world.

228
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,237
It's quite the opposite,

229
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:41,143
that the urge to take control

230
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,404
of all possible futures

231
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:45,522
is a more fundamental principle

232
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:46,885
than that of intelligence,

233
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:50,585
that general intelligence may in fact emerge

234
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:54,144
directly from this sort of control-grabbing,

235
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:58,329
rather than vice versa.

236
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:02,098
Another important consequence is goal seeking.

237
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:06,458
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals

238
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,078
follow from this sort of framework?

239
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,106
And the answer is, the ability to seek goals

240
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,988
will follow directly from this

241
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,822
in the following sense:

242
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,687
just like you would travel through a tunnel,

243
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:20,192
a bottleneck in your future path space,

244
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:22,063
in order to achieve many other

245
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,084
diverse objectives later on,

246
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,456
or just like you would invest

247
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,243
in a financial security,

248
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,480
reducing your short-term liquidity

249
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
in order to increase your wealth over the long term,

250
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,217
goal seeking emerges directly

251
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,946
from a long-term drive

252
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:40,983
to increase future freedom of action.

253
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:44,511
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,

254
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,183
once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed

255
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:50,076
and you could pass only a single concept

256
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,447
on to our descendants

257
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:53,754
to help them rebuild civilization,

258
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,440
that concept should be

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,292
that all matter around us

260
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,615
is made out of tiny elements

261
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:02,123
that attract each other when they're far apart

262
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:05,453
but repel each other when they're close together.

263
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,234
My equivalent of that statement

264
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,502
to pass on to descendants

265
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,214
to help them build artificial intelligences

266
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:14,163
or to help them understand human intelligence,

267
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:15,430
is the following:

268
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,483
Intelligence should be viewed

269
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,896
as a physical process

270
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,861
that tries to maximize future freedom of action

271
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,477
and avoid constraints in its own future.

272
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,835
Thank you very much.

273
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:30,835
(Applause)
