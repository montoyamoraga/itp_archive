## class 01: dada and surrealism

### assignment 01

the role of chance in one work by one dada or surrealist artist: i chose artist [kurt schwitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters)' [simultangedicht kaa gee dee](http://ubu.com/sound/dada.html) sound piece.

questions:
* what was the artist's motivation or intention?

i couldn't find any information directly from the artist, but i think a clue stands in the title of the piece, simultangedicht, which stands for simultaneous poem. my guess is that the artist used these made-up words and sounds in unison and clashing with each other, in order to mimic stream of consciousness, with repeated variations of patterns, a certain rhythm and emphasis, which resembles a lot free-form thinking.

* did others in the movement employ similar strategies? what did they hope to effect?

fellow surrealist artists also used stream of consciousness as inspiration, which is reflected in the dream-like sequences of salvador dalí and even in his collaboration with luis buñuel, un chien andalou, which is a landmark in modern art and which resonates in several spheres, such as the influence it had on late 1980's band pixies, who based their song debaser, first track on their second album, on this surrealist film.

i think that these works try to break with art tradition and try to explore the rich imagery of dreams and the possibilities that randomness and non-linearity provide. they hope to convey feelings that are hard to describe, by bypassing reason and appealing directly to the subconscious.

* what was the context for the work? what was happening historically?

this work was done in early 1920's, right after the end of world war i, which was a time where reason had justified these massive war between supposedly civilized cultures, so that nothing made much sense anymore and it was a failure of the modern world.

## class 02: the situatonist international

### assignment 02

create a sketch prototype or draft of an artwork (that means your artwork!) inspired by one of the following strategies:
* a chance collage
* an algorithmic derive (and how to document results)
* an automatic drawing

my project consists of using data scraped from my non-awake time to turn them into art. i'm thinking of setting up a high-gain mic in my room to detect the noises i make, putting a kinect to sense and record my movements while asleep, using my fitbit data to know how much time did i sleep, how many times i woke up or was restless, and setting up a webcam to detect my transition from conscious to unconscious.

my project is inspired by the jealousy i feel of salvador dali's awesome oniric paintings, fueled by my never remembering anything of the dreams i have, except when they are very graphic nightmares. also, it is intended to counter the supposed non-profitable time i spent sleeping every day (it is productive in the sense that is necessary to be a functioning human being the rest of the day).

i'm thinking of doing a chance self-portrait, where my webcam takes pictures of me according to a certain set of rules, and according to facial expression indicators, takes the decision between including the piece or not.

or a sound piece - music score that takes as input this data.

consider the following:
* what is a contemporary version of this strategy?

* how have conditions of creation and reception changed?

* how have media and materials changed

photos used to be physical, now they can be digital too.

* assuming that the original works were in response to something, what
analogies exist now, that mirror or echo the concerns of the time in which these strategies originated?

my concern is with identity, one of the things i have been more impressed about is the proliferation of social media and the naming of the "selfie" and the popularity of the book [selfish](https://www.amazon.com/Kim-Kardashian-West-Selfish/dp/0789332809/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487256953&sr=8-1&keywords=selfish+kim+kardashian) by kim kardashian west.

* you will have 5 minutes to present next week


### work during the class

with my group we wrote this random walk during class:

1. doubt yourself
2. flip a coin, if you catch it, blink
3. check out the hour in your clock, take the minutes, divide them by 10 and round up to the nearest integer
4. go to that floor on the building
5. find the nearest plant and tell it a secret you have told no one ever
6. the fifth person you make eye contact with, invite them for coffee
7. if they say yes, say you can't right now and give them a fake number, if they say no, beg for 1 minute and give up, if they say yes, say you will go if they pay for it
8. look up the weather and the temperature in fahrenheit degrees
9. find the nearest person wearing red and follow them for x steps, where x is the temperature in fahrenheit degrees
10. if they catch you following them, do a moonwalk
11. hold your breath and escape until you have to breathe in again
12. believe in yourself
13. lift the heaviest object you can see
14. get in the elevator and ask the people inside what do they think about the last text you got
15. wait until the doors open to the fourth floor, when they do, exit the elevator



## class 03: fluxus

research the role of chance in one work or a closely related set of works by one fluxus artist. i chose the work (flux smile machine)[http://www.artpool.hu/lehetetlen/real-kiall/nevek/maciunas_smile.html] credited to [george maciunas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Maciunas)

questions you must answer:
* what was the artist’s motivation or intention?

the artist's motivation was to critique and raise awareness of the disconnect between capitalism and human happiness, between medicine and welness and ultimately, between authenticity and pose.

this device converts a non-smile into a smile, and includes on the fox a grimacing face, serving as an example of the outcome.

this relationship between happiness and manufacture is not the only work by maciunas addresing this: his grotesque gace mask states that " happiness is manufactured, ..., it must be made to happen, sometimes painfully... to be “real,” happiness must come from within."

Fluxus-related artist yoko ono did box of smile:: “i would like to see the sky machine on every corner of the street instead of the coke machine...we need more skies than coke.”

* did others in the movement employ similar strategies? What did they hope to effect?

the format of packaging artwork as a kit or boxset was used in other fluxus works such as the (fluxus boxes)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Maciunas#/media/File:FluxYearBox2.jpg] compiled by george maciunas and also on the artist's book [water yam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Yam_(artist%27s_book))by [george brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brecht).

my guess is that they are trying to hack capitalism and the market, by opting out of the format of producing just one piece of artwork, but rather opting for serializing and mass-producing their ideas. i don't think they are using it as a mean of achieving a wider audience, but rather as a satire of capitalism, which is augmented by the contraposition of the work and a regular product.
